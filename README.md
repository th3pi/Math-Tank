#### is an android quiz game based on Java. My first android application. The idea of it is to improve quick math skills, to train user's brain to solve math problems quickly and easily - by looking for patterns.

# 2. Time trials Shark
#### In this game mode, user is given 8 seconds to answer each question. There is no time limit, however questions only get harder. Timer resets after each correct answer. The same feedback mechanics for each question apply to this game mode as well. User is given both visual and physical feedback based on their answers.

# 3. Advanced Shark
#### Advanced shark is for those who really want a challenge. This game asks user the hard questions, however still maintaining a pattern so that user don't have to do as much math as just using common sense. Which is really the main point of this app. Advanced shark introduces square root, square and cube problems as well as upping the difficulty by making equations longer. No time limit in advanced shark. User go on for as long as user like, whenever user feel like user are done - just click on the timer and the session will end. A score card will be displayed letting user know how user did.

# Settings
#### This app includes a very powerful settings menu. User can customize the look of the app(dark mode), music, difficulty of questions and what kind of questions user get. 
#### Kids mode makes all the problems very easy - great to let kids learn and practice quick maths. 
#### User can enable dark mode if user're not feeling very bright and happy for some reason.
#### User can practice specific type of problems if user feel like user need more practice at it. The app will automatically start showing more problems that user're weak at. But if user feel like user only want that specific set of problems - user have the option.
